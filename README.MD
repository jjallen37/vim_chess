# VimChess  
This project is a fork of the [everonesdesign's](https://github.com/everyonesdesign/) awesome project, [Chess-Helper](https://github.com/everyonesdesign/Chess-Helper). This was built as a hobby project and there is no intention to publish this to any Broswer extension store. Maybe it could eventually make it's way into the main project :)

## About 

A small Google Chrome extension adding a Vim-like keyboard navigation experience to [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) website.

## [Youtube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYbrvXg3Fhw)

## **This project is currently broken ðŸ˜“**
I waited too long to publish this, and now it looks like Chess.com implemented more keyboard controls for emojis. Until I can get that resolved, the demo video might be the only way to see this in action.

# Vim-Like:
- "Normal mode commands are designed to be typed as a sequence of keystrokes. Itâ€™s the Qwerty equivalent of playing a melody on the piano keyboard"
- Composable Commands
  - Vim: yit => Yank in Tag. 
  - VimChess: cE => Pawn on 3rd rank takes opposite left-side bishop.
  - ChessHelper: c3xB

# FAQ:
Q: Is this necessary:  
A: No. But it is kinda neat.

Q: Did it make you good at chess:  
A: The opposite. I stopped studying chess to write this.
